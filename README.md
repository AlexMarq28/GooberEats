# GooberEats is a delivery planning and route planning service for a robot food delivery app. Map data is taken in as street segments defined by two points. Point to point routing is done using an A*
#like algorithm to determine the shortest route. When multiple deliveries are queued, logic is done to rearrange them into an efficient ordering.
